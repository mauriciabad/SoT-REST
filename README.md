## Assignment statement

Make a REST service and client(s) for the required case: **searching and buying flight tickets (for travelling with an airplane)**. You may make it simple or advanced, for example: clients can create account, search for flight tickets and buy them, etc.

## General comments

- All the data is encoded in `json` format.
- ID's are generated automatically, if you provide one in a POST or PUT request this will be ignored.
- When a list is requested the response contains the header `X-Total-Count` with the amount of items in the list.
- CORS enabled with header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.
- `OPTIONS` method is also implemented.
- Flights can be filtered by all this parameters: `flightId`, `origin`, `destination`, `departure`, `departureBefore`, `departureAfter`, `arrival`, `arrivalBefore`, `arrivalAfter`, `price`, `maxPrice` and/or `airline`.

## 1st Client - Java console

![Console client demo](documentation/console-client-demo.gif)

Run the class [`Main`](https://github.com/mauriciabad/SoT-REST/blob/master/client/src/main/java/Main.java) inside `client` module.

> **Note**: you can write the options in lowercase and will still work.

> **Disclaimer 1**: I wanted to make a preatier display of the entities, instead of just writing the JSON. But because working with JSON in Java is a nightmare I left like this.

> **Disclaimer 2**: *The Intellij Idea console made me code dirty workarrounds*. 
> - No Unicode support.
> - The `Console` class is incompatible.
> - The graddle run button doesn't work straight away. 
> 
> So I couldn't use fancy Emojis, I had to make my own Console class, and running the code must be done from the regular Intellij Play button...

## 2nd Client - Web React.js

![Web client demo](documentation/web-client-demo.gif)

![Web client run instructions](documentation/web-client-instructions.png)

You MUST run the app in localhost, or open the file `[/web-client/build/index.html](https://github.com/mauriciabad/SoT-REST/blob/master/web-client/build/index.html)` from the computer.

- The source code is inside the `/web-client` folder. 
- The compiled files are inside the `/web-client/build` folder. 

> I used the [react-admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/) framework to build it.

_When you deploy the apache tomcat server it will give you nice instructions about how to run the 2nd client._

## Error handling

Some errors can occur when:
- A required parameter is missing.
- The specified item does not exist.
- Date parameter has wrong format.
- Try to buy a ticket not for sale.

### Example custom error message

```json
{
  "error": true,
  "message": "Flight with flightId 999 doesn't exist",
  "status": 404,
  "statusName": "Not Found"
}
```

### Implementing a Composite service

The idea I had is the **Custom Flights Recomendation**. 

One use case would be:
1. Ask the costumer's favorite football team.
1. Call a `Football API` to know when and where is the next match.
1. Call our `Airline API` to get the flights there.
1. Check in a `Weather API` the weather for the departure and arival times.
1. Send a recomendation emailthrought `Mailing API` with all that information to the costumer.

This would call several services from one service.

## HTTP messages

Real HTTP messages being transferred between client and server. 

We can see the input and output of some CRUD operations of `/flights` and different kinds of encodings.
